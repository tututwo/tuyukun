•  Improved a   instrumental  calculation method to accurately measure the absorption spectrum of fluorescent solutions.
•  With hundreds of  experiments   and correction, we rejected the   theoretical data about fluophor esculetin by measuring the experimental value of the fluophor's ESPT rate constant and its quantum yield dependent on pH levels.
•  Research is published at "Aesculetin Exhibits Strong Fluorescent Photoacid Character", as co-author.
